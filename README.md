# Horiseon_Optimization
This is an optimized version of the already existing Horsieon site that has been updated to become more readable and accessible.


## Building and Running
The site can be run by right clicking anywhere on the HTML page and clicking "Open in Default Browser". Or you can view the page by going to "https://mmarsolek.github.io/Horiseon_Optimization/"


## Consideration
I updated this site so it would be accessible for to those using screen readers and cleaned up the CSS to make it more readable. I also updated the font color at the bottom so it is easily visible to those that are colorblind.

## Things I learned and problems I solved
- This project also pushed the importance of basic code upkeep. That includes proper indentation, clearing cluttered code, and commenting.
- I needed to keep track of which 'h' tags I was using and I needed to make sure I was using them in proper order. 
- This project helped to expand my knowledge of different tags and how they effect people using assistance devices.
