# Horiseon_Optimization
An optimized version of the existing Horsieon site to help become more efficient and accessable.
## Building and Running
The site can be run by right clicking anywhere on the HTML page and clicking "Open in Default Browser". Or you can view the page by going to "https://mmarsolek.github.io/Horiseon_Optimization/"

## Consideration
I updated this site so it would be accesable for to those using screen readers. I also updated the font color at the bottom so it is easily visible to those that are colorblind.

## Things I learned and problems I solved
- This project helped to expand my knowledge of different tags and how they effect people using assistance devices.
